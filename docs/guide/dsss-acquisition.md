# DSSS Burst Acquisition

`doppler.dsss.BurstAcquisition` acquires a direct-sequence spread-spectrum burst —
a run of repeated, BPSK-modulated PN-code segments — arriving with an **unknown
code phase** and an **unknown carrier-frequency (Doppler) offset**, buried in
noise. It owns the whole receive-side acquisition pipeline:

```
raw cf32  →  ring  →  reframe (doppler_bins, code_bins)  →  slow-time Doppler FFT
          →  code correlation (corr2d)  →  CFAR gate  →  (Doppler, code-phase) hits
```

Construction is **physics-only**: you state the waveform (`code`, `chip_rate`),
the front end (`spc`), the sensitivity (`cn0_dbhz`), and a target **(Pfa, Pd)**.
The engine sizes its own search grid — coherent depth, threshold, non-coherent
looks — from the [detection theory](../api/python-detection.md) and streams
detections. You never pick a bin count or a threshold.

!!! note "Two front doors, one engine"

    `BurstAcquisition` (this page) is for exactly the case above — an
    isolated, data-free run of repeated code (a preamble). For a
    **continuous**, data-modulated signal instead — a beacon/telemetry
    stream where the code repeats forever with async data riding on top
    — use `doppler.dsss.Acquisition` instead; see
    [Continuous, data-modulated signals](#continuous-data-modulated-signals-the-asynchronous-symbol-clock-case)
    below. Both are thin front doors over the same C engine and share the
    same `push`/streaming/property surface — they differ only in how the
    Doppler axis is searched and which construction parameters make sense.

This is the usage walk-through. For the matched-filter surface it builds on, see
[2-D Acquisition](../gallery/detection2d.md) (`CorrDetector2D`); for what happens
*after* acquisition, see the [DSSS BurstDespreader](../api/python-dsss.md).

## The acquisition problem

A spread-spectrum transmitter sends the same PN segment over and over (the
acquisition preamble). By the time it reaches you it has an unknown **code
phase** (propagation delay, a circular shift of the code) and an unknown
**carrier offset** (Doppler), and it is well below the noise floor. Acquisition
is the 2-D search that recovers both at once:

- **code phase** — *where* in the code period the signal sits (the matched-filter
    lag), and
- **Doppler bin** — *how far* the carrier has shifted.

`BurstAcquisition` evaluates the entire (Doppler × code-phase) grid per frame and
reports the cells whose detection statistic crosses an automatically set CFAR
gate.

______________________________________________________________________

## How it works — slow-time / fast-time

Acquisition is a delay–Doppler search, and `BurstAcquisition` factors it into two
FFTs over the repeated-segment structure. It frames the stream into a
`(doppler_bins, code_bins)` matrix where **each row is one PN segment — one code
repetition** — and there are `doppler_bins` of them:

- **fast-time** — *within* one segment (`code_bins = sf·spc` samples). A circular
    correlation against the known code → the **code-phase** axis.
- **slow-time** — *across* the `doppler_bins` segments. An FFT along that axis
    resolves the per-segment carrier phase ramp → the **Doppler** axis.

```
            fast-time  (code_bins = sf·spc samples, one segment)
          ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
slow-time │ rep 0   · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · │
(rows =   │ rep 1   · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · │   FFT down ──► Doppler
 code     │  ...                                        │   columns
 reps)    │ rep d-1 · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · │
          └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                      │ circular code correlation
                      ▼  along each row → code phase
```

The coherent depth `doppler_bins` is **chosen by the engine** — the smallest
number of repetitions in `[1, reps]` that meets `pd` at your `cn0_dbhz` (more on
that below). Internally the fast-time correlation is the FFT-domain
[`Corr2D`](../gallery/detection2d.md) engine against a **single-row reference**
(the code in row 0, zeros elsewhere); the slow-time FFT is applied to the data
*before* that correlation. Because the engine ingests **raw** samples and does
the slow-time FFT itself, you never pre-transform anything — just `push` IQ.

!!! note "Doppler resolution and range (in Hz)"

    Two independent quantities, both reported as read-only properties:

    - **resolution** `doppler_res_hz = chip_rate / (sf · doppler_bins)` — set by
        how many repetitions the engine integrates (deeper → finer bins).
    - **span** `doppler_span_hz = ±chip_rate / (2·sf)` — the slow-time Nyquist,
        set by the *code period* (`sf` chips) alone, independent of `spc` and
        `doppler_bins`.

    With `sf=31`, `chip_rate=1.023 MHz`, `doppler_bins=12`: bins are ≈2750 Hz
    apart, spanning ±16.5 kHz. To search *wider* than the native span, sweep a
    coarse Doppler grid in front of `Acquisition` — see
    [Widening the Doppler search](#widening-the-doppler-search).

______________________________________________________________________

## Auto-configuration from the physics

You do not pick a threshold, a coherent depth, or a bin count — you state the
operating point and the engine derives the grid with the
[detection functions](../api/python-detection.md).

First it converts your sensitivity to the per-sample amplitude SNR the detection
math uses (noise power = `N0·fs` over the sampled bandwidth):

```
fs   = chip_rate · spc
snr  = sqrt( 10**(cn0_dbhz/10) / fs )      # per-sample amplitude SNR
```

Then it picks the **smallest** coherent depth `D ∈ [1, reps]` whose `D·code_bins`
coherent samples meet `pd` — least latency for a strong signal, full `reps` for a
weak one:

```
for D in 1 .. reps:
    cells     = searched_bins(D) · code_bins      # Bonferroni population
    pfa_cell  = 1 - (1 - pfa)**(1/cells)
    eta       = det_threshold(pfa_cell)           # √(-2 ln pfa_cell)
    if mean_pd(snr, D, eta) ≥ pd: break  # Pd AVERAGED over the straddle
                                         # priors (quadrature), not on-grid
doppler_bins = D
threshold    = eta · √(2/π)                        # eta in mean-CFAR units
```

The chosen grid is exposed as **read-only** properties:

```python
acq = BurstAcquisition(code, reps=16, spc=4, chip_rate=1.023e6, cn0_dbhz=52,
                        pfa=1e-3, pd=0.9)

acq.doppler_bins, acq.code_bins   # 12, 124   — the grid the engine chose
acq.doppler_span_hz, acq.doppler_res_hz   # ±16500 Hz, 2750 Hz
acq.fs                            # 4.092e6   — chip_rate · spc
acq.pfa_cell                      # per-cell false-alarm prob (Bonferroni)
acq.eta                           # raw Rayleigh threshold √(-2 ln pfa_cell)
acq.threshold                     # the CFAR gate actually applied (eta·√(2/π))
acq.n_noncoh                      # non-coherent looks (1 = pure coherent)
acq.pd_predicted, acq.underpowered   # achieved Pd, and whether it fell short
```

### Check `underpowered` after construction

When the operating point is infeasible — even `reps` coherent repetitions plus
the auto-selected non-coherent looks (up to an internal safety-valve ceiling of
256 — not a caller-facing knob; see [Waveform vs. operator
knobs](#waveform-vs-operator-knobs) below) cannot reach `pd` — auto-config does
**not** raise; it builds a best-effort grid with `pd_predicted < pd`, sets
`acq.underpowered = True`, and emits a `UserWarning`. Guard against shipping an
under-powered acquirer:

```python
assert acq.pd_predicted >= acq.pd, f"under-powered: {acq.pd_predicted:.2f}"
```

The levers that close a shortfall are a higher `cn0_dbhz` (if the signal really
is stronger), more `reps` (deeper coherent integration), or a tighter
`doppler_uncertainty`. Non-coherent looks (`n_noncoh`) already auto-engage once
`reps` is exhausted — there's no separate opt-in for them.

`cn0_dbhz` is the universal sensitivity spec — carrier-to-noise **density** in
dB-Hz, independent of sample rate. A stronger `cn0_dbhz` lets the engine reach
`pd` with fewer repetitions (lower latency, coarser Doppler):

Depths are sized at the **average Pd over the straddle priors** (random
Doppler and code phase across the grid — see `acq.straddle_loss` for the
mean amplitude derating), so the engine buys enough integration to meet
`pd` in operation, not just on-grid:

| `cn0_dbhz` | chosen `doppler_bins` (reps=16) | `pd_predicted` |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 56         | 5                               | 0.94           |
| 54         | 7                               | 0.91           |
| 52         | 12                              | 0.92           |

`noise_mode` selects the CFAR estimator (`"mean"` by default, which is what the
analytic `threshold` assumes; `"median"` is more robust but is not analytically
calibrated).

______________________________________________________________________

## Streaming and reading hits

`push` accepts any-length cf32 blocks, buffers them in a ring, and emits one
detection per coherent **frame** (or, on the non-coherent path, per `n_noncoh`
accumulated frames) whose statistic clears the gate. Each hit is a 7-tuple:

```python
for dop, phase, peak, noise, stat, cn0, samples_consumed in acq.push(chunk):
    ...
```

| field              | meaning                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `doppler_bin`      | peak row — slow-time Doppler bin (`0 … doppler_bins-1`)                            |
| `code_phase`       | peak column — integer-sample code phase (`0 … code_bins-1`)                        |
| `peak_mag`         | peak correlation magnitude over the surface                                        |
| `noise_est`        | CFAR noise estimate                                                                |
| `test_stat`        | `peak_mag / noise_est` (compared against `threshold`)                              |
| `cn0_dbhz_est`     | estimated carrier-to-noise density (dB-Hz), comparable to `cn0_dbhz`               |
| `samples_consumed` | raw sample offset (since this engine's own stream start) this hit's epoch ended at |

Map the integer bins back to physical units:

```python
def doppler_hz(dop, acq):
    """Doppler bin → Hz (folds the upper half to negative)."""
    k = (dop + acq.doppler_bins // 2) % acq.doppler_bins - acq.doppler_bins // 2
    return k * acq.doppler_res_hz

delay_chips = phase / acq.spc          # code phase in chips
```

`reset()` drains the ring and the coherent accumulator (use it between
independent captures).

!!! note "Code phase tracks the stream offset"

    The code phase is measured against the frame grid, which is anchored at sample
    0\. Inserting `Δ` extra samples of lead-in (silence) before the burst shifts
    every reported `code_phase` by `Δ mod code_bins` — that offset *is* extra
    propagation delay. Frame the same burst at a different stream position and the
    Doppler bin is unchanged but the code phase rotates accordingly.

______________________________________________________________________

## How many hits to expect

Acquisition fires once per coherent frame while the burst fills the search
window. The engine frames on a fixed grid anchored at stream sample 0, so a frame
produces full processing gain only when its whole `n = doppler_bins·code_bins`
window lies inside the burst. For a burst of `R` segments (`R·code_bins` samples)
after `L` lead-in samples, the count of full-gain frames is

```
F = (L + R·code_bins) // n  -  ceil(L / n)
```

On the pure-coherent path each full frame yields one hit. A **frame-aligned**
lead-in (`L` a multiple of `n`) gives exactly `F` hits at one cell; a non-aligned
lead-in gives `F` to `F+2` (boundary frames that straddle the burst edge may also
fire) and rotates the code phase by `L mod code_bins`. On the non-coherent path
(`n_noncoh > 1`) a hit arrives once per `n_noncoh` accumulated frames. A payload
that follows the preamble on a **different** code decorrelates from the matched
filter and does not produce burst-cell hits.

______________________________________________________________________

## Choosing parameters

### The minimum you must supply

Construction is physics-only, and only three arguments have no meaningful
default. The smallest robust call is:

```python
acq = BurstAcquisition(
    code,                 # the PN replica; sf = len(code) is inferred
    chip_rate=1.023e6,    # waveform chip rate (Hz)
    cn0_dbhz=61,          # your link-budget sensitivity (dB-Hz)
)
assert acq.pd_predicted >= acq.pd   # confirm the search can meet the target
```

The tiers:

- **Required — no meaningful default:** `code` (the PN replica), `chip_rate` (the
    waveform), and `cn0_dbhz` (the sensitivity; its placeholder default sizes a
    toy grid, so set it to your real link budget).
- **Set for your front end:** `spc` (samples/chip = `sample_rate / chip_rate`;
    default 4) and `reps` (how many coherent code repetitions you can afford —
    the coherence ceiling and your latency budget; default 1).
- **Safe defaults — leave unless you have a reason:** `pfa=1e-3`, `pd=0.9`,
    `noise_mode="mean"`, `doppler_uncertainty=0` (full native span).
- **Nothing to opt into for weak signals:** non-coherent looks (`n_noncoh`) are
    always auto-selected once the coherent ceiling (`reps`) is exhausted, up to
    an internal safety-valve ceiling (256 looks) — there is no caller-facing
    cap to raise.

`sf` is **not** a parameter — it is inferred from `len(code)`, so the engine and
your replica can never disagree.

### Waveform vs. operator knobs

Some inputs describe the **transmitted waveform** — the receiver must match them,
they are not knobs:

- **`code`** — the PN sequence; its length *is* `sf` (the spreading factor).
- **`chip_rate`** — the transmitter's chip rate (Hz). With `spc` it sets the
    sample rate `fs = chip_rate·spc` and the Doppler **span** `±chip_rate/(2·sf)`.
- **`spc`** — **samples per chip** (chip-rate oversampling; *not* samples per
    *symbol* — that is `sps`) = your `sample_rate / chip_rate`. You only move it by
    resampling the front end.

The genuine receiver / operator knobs:

| Goal                                 | Lever                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tighter false-alarm rate             | smaller **`pfa`** (raises `threshold`)                       |
| Hold `pd` at lower C/N0              | larger **`reps`** (deeper coherent integration)              |
| More sensitive within a known offset | tighter **`doppler_uncertainty`** (fewer cells → lower gate) |
| Robust noise estimate (uncalibrated) | **`noise_mode="median"`**                                    |

`reps` sets the coherent ceiling; the engine uses the *smallest* depth that meets
`pd`, so raising `reps` only helps weak signals (a strong one still resolves in a
few repetitions). Reaching below the coherent ceiling isn't a separate lever —
once `reps` is exhausted, the engine auto-escalates non-coherent looks
(`n_noncoh`, read-only) on its own, up to the internal 256-look safety valve;
there's no `max_noncoh` to raise.

!!! warning "`reps` assumes a data-free coherent window"

    Deeper coherent integration (a larger `reps`/`doppler_bins`) is only safe for
    the classic **preamble** case this section describes — a data-free code
    repeated back to back. Raising it on a **continuous, data-modulated**
    signal doesn't just cost some gain, it can produce a deterministic
    **mislock** onto the wrong Doppler bin. See
    [Continuous, data-modulated signals](#continuous-data-modulated-signals-the-asynchronous-symbol-clock-case)
    below before reaching for `reps` on that kind of signal.

### Narrowing the Doppler search

If you already know the carrier offset lies within `±Δf`, pass
`doppler_uncertainty=Δf` (Hz, ≤ the native span). The engine then scans only the
Doppler bins inside that band, so the CFAR threshold pays a Bonferroni penalty
over **fewer** cells — a lower gate at the same system `pfa`, i.e. more
sensitivity for free. A value beyond the native span is rejected (`MemoryError`);
to search wider, use the coarse-mix bank below.

______________________________________________________________________

## Continuous, data-modulated signals — the asynchronous-symbol-clock case

Everything above assumes the classic **preamble** case: an isolated run of the
*same*, data-free code repeated back to back, so any coherent depth up to
`reps` sums honestly. That assumption breaks for a **continuous** carrier —
e.g. a beacon or telemetry stream where the spreading code repeats forever and
BPSK data rides on top continuously, with a symbol clock that is *not* an
integer multiple of the code-epoch clock (`chip_rate / symbol_rate` not a
whole number — the common case in real hardware, where the two clocks derive
from independent budgets). `BurstAcquisition` is the wrong tool for this case
full stop, not just a tuning risk — reach for `doppler.dsss.Acquisition`
instead (below).

### Why this changes the sizing decision

A data-bit transition landing *inside* one coherent epoch splits that epoch's
contribution into two oppositely-signed halves. This does more than cost some
correlation gain at the true code phase — it can produce a genuine,
deterministic **mislock**: the code's off-peak correlation has no bound over
an unequal-length partial window the way it does over a full period, so at
some *other* candidate phase the two mis-signed partial sums can happen to add
constructively and beat the (weakened) true-phase peak. This is not a noise
event — see
[DSSS Acquisition — Continuous Async-Data Modulation](../gallery/dsss-acq-async-data.md)
for the worked proof: a bad epoch replayed with all injected noise removed
reproduces the identical mislock, bit for bit.

The failure only shows up once your coherent window spans more than a small
fraction of a symbol — which is exactly what a naive
`BurstAcquisition(code, reps=16, ...)` call risks on a signal like this: its
whole reason for existing is to greedily grow the coherent depth
(`doppler_bins`) up to `reps` to meet `pd`, with no notion that a
data-modulated symbol clock might be present at all — `BurstAcquisition` only
ever sees a `code` and a `chip_rate`. There is no parameter that makes this
class safe here; the fix is to use the other front door.

### The robust default: `Acquisition`, not `BurstAcquisition`

`Acquisition` (continuous) closes this footgun structurally rather than
pricing it as a tunable trade-off: it **always** window-tiles the Doppler
search (rolling one epoch's own FFT spectrum across parallel frequency-window
hypotheses — the same mechanism as [Widening the Doppler
search](#widening-the-doppler-search) below, but built in) and **never**
attempts coherent multi-epoch combining, regardless of `doppler_uncertainty`
or how strong the signal is. There is no `reps`-like ceiling to raise by
mistake, because there is no coherent-depth axis on this class at all.
Sensitivity margin comes entirely from `n_noncoh`, which is always
auto-selected to meet `pd` (up to the same internal 256-look safety valve as
`BurstAcquisition`) — never a caller-tuned cap.

Given the high-level inputs a typical caller actually has — the `code`, the
`chip_rate`, a Doppler uncertainty, and a `cn0_dbhz` sensitivity — construction
looks just like `BurstAcquisition`'s, minus `reps`:

```python
from doppler.dsss import Acquisition

chip_rate = 1.023e6            # Hz, the waveform (matches the code above)
symbol_rate = 2400.0           # Hz -- present and asynchronous to chip_rate
doppler_uncertainty = 5000.0   # Hz, your link's Doppler budget

acq = Acquisition(
    code, chip_rate=chip_rate, cn0_dbhz=52,
    spc=4, doppler_uncertainty=doppler_uncertainty,
    symbol_rate=symbol_rate,  # diagnostic only -- see below
    pfa=1e-3, pd=0.9,
)
assert acq.pd_predicted >= acq.pd    # a higher cn0_dbhz or tighter
                                      # doppler_uncertainty closes a shortfall
                                      # (there is no reps/max_noncoh to raise)
assert acq.doppler_bins == 1         # doppler_uncertainty (5 kHz) is inside
                                      # the native span here, so one window
                                      # covers it -- widening it further would
                                      # just tile more single-epoch windows,
                                      # never a coherent depth
```

`symbol_rate` (and the derived read-only `epochs_per_symbol`) are
**diagnostic only** on this class — they don't feed sizing at all, because
sizing never had a coherent-depth axis to protect from the data clock in the
first place. Pass it if you want `epochs_per_symbol` for your own logging;
omit it and nothing about the search changes.

This is the robust default for a second, independent reason beyond the
mislock: **it doesn't require phase coherency across the integration window.**
A coherent stack over several epochs (`BurstAcquisition`'s `doppler_bins > 1`)
is a single-frequency-hypothesis slow-time FFT — it implicitly assumes the
carrier's phase evolves predictably across the *entire* window. Any unmodeled
dynamics inside that window (residual acceleration, oscillator phase noise, a
Doppler rate finer than the bin grid resolves) bleeds coherent gain away as
the window lengthens, on top of whatever the data-transition mechanism costs.
`Acquisition`'s non-coherent combining is blind to phase between looks by
construction, so it is immune to that failure mode too — a real channel has
these drift sources even when a controlled simulation does not model them.
The one thing you give up is the classic non-coherent combining loss (roughly
1–3 dB versus the same total energy combined ideally coherently, for small
`N`) — a fair price for robustness on a continuous, data-modulated link.

!!! info "`doppler_resolution`/`doppler_rate` were removed, not left as knobs"

    An earlier iteration of this class also had `doppler_resolution` (floor a
    minimum Doppler-bin resolution) and `doppler_rate` (cap the coherent depth
    for Doppler-rate smearing). Both existed to serve a genuine, separate
    need — handing a finer Doppler estimate to a downstream tracking loop —
    but both worked by **forcing the coherent depth up**, exactly the
    mislock risk this section describes. Confirmed directly on this
    project's own continuous receiver: forcing `doppler_bins` up via
    `doppler_resolution` to shrink a downstream carrier-loop's pull-in range
    caused *frequent, gross* mislocks (the wrong Doppler bin winning
    outright, not just reduced accuracy) — the data modulation's own
    baseband spectrum, sampled at close to one sample per symbol, is
    broadband enough to alias real energy across the *entire* Doppler-bin
    axis once the coherent window spans more than a handful of symbols.
    Rather than leave a foot-gun knob on the class with a "use with care"
    caveat, both were removed entirely: `Acquisition` (continuous) has no
    coherent-depth axis left for either one to force up, so the guarantee
    above (`doppler_bins` is always the window-tile count, never a
    slow-time FFT depth) is now structural, not a documentation promise. A
    finer Doppler estimate downstream is still a real need; it belongs to a
    resolution mechanism that doesn't grow real coherent depth (zero-padding
    the Doppler FFT, not yet shipped), not a parameter on this constructor.

### When `BurstAcquisition` is still the right call

If there is no continuous data modulation to speak of — a genuine data-free
preamble, the classic case the rest of this guide describes — none of this
applies: use `BurstAcquisition` and get the coherent-first sizing (`reps`
grown before non-coherent looks engage), which pays no combining-loss
penalty. Reach for `Acquisition` (continuous) only when the code carries
continuous data modulation during acquisition itself.

### Advanced: pinning the grid directly

Both classes' auto-config are convenience layers over the same underlying
knob: `doppler_bins` and `n_noncoh`. If you already know the grid you want —
from a prior characterization run, or because you want to A/B two specific
configurations without reconstructing the object — `configure_search_raw`
pins it directly, bypassing auto-sizing:

```python
acq.configure_search_raw(doppler_bins=1, n_noncoh=8)
```

It resizes every buffer/plan the grid touches (the slow-time FFT, the code
correlator, every per-frame scratch buffer) and re-derives the threshold
ladder for that exact grid, clearing any in-flight accumulation — call it
between `push()` calls, never a substitute for one. Bounds are still
enforced (`doppler_bins ∈ [1, reps]` — on `Acquisition` (continuous), `reps`
is internally pinned to `1`, so this collapses to `doppler_bins == 1` there;
`n_noncoh ∈ [1, 256]`, the same internal safety-valve ceiling as auto-config);
an out-of-range pin raises `ValueError` and leaves the engine at its prior
grid.

!!! warning "Pinning a large `doppler_bins` on `BurstAcquisition` bypasses the mislock protection too"

    `configure_search_raw` is a direct pin — it doesn't know or care whether
    your signal is continuous and data-modulated. Pinning a large
    `doppler_bins` on `BurstAcquisition` reintroduces exactly the mislock risk
    described in
    [Continuous, data-modulated signals](#continuous-data-modulated-signals-the-asynchronous-symbol-clock-case)
    above, with no honest Pd pricing to warn you. Only pin a coherent depth
    beyond a handful of epochs when you know the window is genuinely
    data-free (a preamble) for its whole span — on a continuous signal, pin
    `Acquisition`'s `n_noncoh` instead (its `doppler_bins` bound collapses to
    `1`, so there's no coherent depth to accidentally pin up).

## Widening the Doppler search

The native search spans only `±chip_rate/(2·sf)` — one slow-time Nyquist, set by
the code period. When the true Doppler exceeds that, tile the wider range with a
sequence of **coarse Doppler hypotheses**: mix the raw stream down by each
`f_coarse` and run `BurstAcquisition` on the result. The engine's fine FFT then
resolves the residual within the native span, and the absolute Doppler is
`f_coarse +` the fine bin.

```python
import numpy as np

chip_rate = 1.0e6
fs = chip_rate * 2                         # spc = 2
coarse = np.arange(-100e3, 100e3, 500.0)   # coarse grid (Hz) — see step rule below
bank = [BurstAcquisition(code, reps=10, spc=2, chip_rate=chip_rate, cn0_dbhz=50,
                         pfa=1e-3, pd=0.9)
        for _ in coarse]                   # one engine per channel (own state)

n0 = 0
for chunk in iq_stream:                                  # any cf32 block
    n = n0 + np.arange(len(chunk))
    for f_coarse, acq in zip(coarse, bank):
        mixed = (chunk * np.exp(-2j * np.pi * f_coarse / fs * n)).astype(np.complex64)
        for dop, phase, *_rest, cn0 in acq.push(mixed):
            k = (dop + acq.doppler_bins // 2) % acq.doppler_bins \
                - acq.doppler_bins // 2
            doppler_hz = f_coarse + k * acq.doppler_res_hz
            print(f"hit: {doppler_hz:+.0f} Hz, code phase {phase}")
    n0 += len(chunk)
```

- **Coarse step.** Within-segment carrier rotation (`residual · code-period`
    cycles) sinc-rolls the code correlation, so keep the residual under ~0.25 cycle
    for \<1 dB loss. Stepping by the **full** native window (`chip_rate/sf`) abuts
    the tiles but leaves a half-window residual at each edge — 0.5 cycle, ~4 dB
    down. Halving the step (50% overlap) drops the residual to 0.25 cycle (\<1 dB)
    at twice the channel count.
- **Relation to the roll method.** Mixing the input is the continuous-frequency
    dual of rolling `conj(FFT(code))` by integer bins (each bin = one native
    window); mixing just lets you choose a finer, half-window step.
- **Cost** scales linearly with the number of coarse channels; the inner fine
    search is unchanged.

### Worked example — 1 Mcps, length-1000 code, ±100 kHz

| quantity              | value                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| chip rate `chip_rate` | 1 Mcps                                         |
| code length `sf`      | 1000 chips                                     |
| code period           | `sf/chip_rate` = 1 ms                          |
| repetitions `reps`    | 10 → up to 10 ms coherent integration          |
| samples/chip `spc`    | 2 → `fs` = 2 Msps, `code_bins = sf·spc` = 2000 |

**Fine (native) search** — the Doppler figures depend only on the waveform, not
`spc` (it cancels):

- resolution = `chip_rate / (sf · doppler_bins)` = `1/(10 ms)` = **100 Hz** at the
    full `doppler_bins = 10`
- span = `±chip_rate / (2·sf)` = **±500 Hz** (10 bins)
- code-phase bins = `code_bins` = **2000** (half-chip, because `spc = 2`)

**Reaching ±100 kHz** — that is 200× the native ±500 Hz window, so sweep a coarse
grid (`200 kHz` total to cover):

- abutting tiles: step = native window = `chip_rate/sf` = **1 kHz** →
    `200 kHz / 1 kHz` = **200 channels**, but the `±500 Hz` edge residual costs
    ~4 dB.
- low-loss (50% overlap): step = `chip_rate/(2·sf)` = **500 Hz** →
    `200 kHz / 500 Hz` = **400 channels**, residual `±250 Hz` (≤ 0.25 cycle, \<1 dB)
    — this is the grid in the snippet above.
- each channel searches a `10 × 2000` (Doppler × code-phase) surface at the native
    **100 Hz** resolution, with full 10 ms coherent gain.

So acquisition is **200–400 fine searches**, one per coarse mix —
`BurstAcquisition` runs the inner search and CFAR; your loop sweeps `f_coarse`.
Halving the requirement
(e.g. ±50 kHz) halves the channel count; a shorter code (smaller `sf`) widens the
native window and cuts the coarse sweep proportionally.

## The DSSS receive chain

`BurstAcquisition` is the front of a two-stage receiver: **acquire**, then
**track**. Once it reports a `(Doppler bin, code phase)`, hand the coarse
estimate to the [`BurstDespreader`](../api/python-dsss.md), which closes a
DLL + Costas loop to track code phase and carrier and recover the payload
bits. Both live in `doppler.dsss`:

```python
from doppler.dsss import BurstAcquisition, BurstDespreader
```
