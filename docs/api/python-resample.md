and return `complex64` NumPy arrays with state preserved across calls.

| Class | Algorithm | Rate | Best for |
|-------|-----------|------|----------|
| `RateConverter` | Auto-selected cascade | any | Single-class interface for all rates |

## `RateConverter` — automatic cascade

Selects the cheapest cascade of CIC, HalfbandDecimator, and/or polyphase
Resampler stages for the requested rate ratio at construction time.  The
cascade is rebuilt transparently whenever `rate` is changed.

### Stage selection

| Condition (D = 1/rate) | Cascade |
|---|---|
| rate ≥ 1.0 or D < 2 | `Resampler(rate)` |
| D ≈ 2 | `HalfbandDecimator` |
| D ≈ 4 | `HalfbandDecimator → HalfbandDecimator` |
| D = 2ⁿ, n ≥ 3, D ≤ 4096 | `CIC(D)` |
| D ≥ 8, non-power-of-2 | `CIC(R*) → Resampler(R*/D)` |
| 2 ≤ D < 8, non-integer | `Resampler(rate)` |

where R\* = nearest power-of-two to D.

```python
from doppler.resample import RateConverter
import numpy as np

x = np.random.randn(4096).astype(np.complex64)

rc = RateConverter(0.5)        # HalfbandDecimator
y = rc.execute(x)              # len(y) = 2048

rc = RateConverter(0.125)      # CIC(8)
y = rc.execute(x)              # len(y) = 512

rc = RateConverter(0.1)        # CIC(8) → Resampler(0.8)
y = rc.execute(x)              # len(y) ≈ 410
print(rc.stages)               # ['CIC(8)', 'Resampler(0.8)']

# Change rate — cascade rebuilt, filter state reset
rc.rate = 0.25
print(rc.stages)               # ['HalfbandDecimator', 'HalfbandDecimator']
```

### Streaming

State is preserved across `execute()` calls; split at any boundary:

```python
rc = RateConverter(0.5)
for block in iq_stream:        # CF32 blocks, any length
    y = rc.execute(block)
    process(y)
```

### Functional wrapper

`rate_convert()` creates a `RateConverter` on the first call and returns it
so it can be passed back to maintain state:

```python
from doppler.resample import rate_convert

y1, rc = rate_convert(x, 0.5)
y2, rc = rate_convert(x, 0.5, rc=rc)   # same converter, state preserved
```

### CIC droop compensation

Pass `compensate=1` to append a passband-droop compensating FIR after any
CIC stage.  The FIR is designed with `ciccompmf(N=4, R=R, M=7)`:

```python
rc = RateConverter(0.125, compensate=1)
# cascade: CIC(8) → FIR-comp(7 taps)
print(rc.stages)   # ['CIC(8)+FIR']
```

---

## `Resampler` — general polyphase

Built-in Kaiser bank (60 dB rejection, 0.4/0.6 pass/stop).  Works for
any rate — integer, fractional, and irrational.

```python
from doppler.resample import Resampler
import numpy as np

x = np.random.randn(4096).astype(np.complex64)

# Decimate 2×
r = Resampler(0.5)
y = r.execute(x)           # len(y) ≈ 2048

# Interpolate 3×
r2 = Resampler(3.0)
y2 = r2.execute(x)         # len(y2) ≈ 12288

# Fractional — irrational rate is fine
r3 = Resampler(44100 / 48000)
y3 = r3.execute(x)

# Custom Kaiser spec (tighter transition band)
r4 = Resampler(0.5, rejection=80.0, passband=0.35, stopband=0.45)
```

### Rate-controlled resampling (FM/Doppler correction)

Per-sample rate deviation via `execute_ctrl`:

```python
ctrl = np.zeros(4096, dtype=np.complex64)  # deviation in norm_freq units
ctrl.real = 1e-4 * doppler_correction
y = r.execute_ctrl(x, ctrl)
```

## `HalfbandDecimator` — fixed 2:1 decimation

Symmetric FIR halfband filter; every other output sample is the identity
(zero multiply) which halves the compute cost vs. a general FIR.
Use as the first stage in a multi-stage DDC chain.

```python
from doppler.resample import HalfbandDecimator
import numpy as np

decim = HalfbandDecimator()          # built-in Kaiser prototype
x = np.random.randn(4096).astype(np.complex64)
y = decim.execute(x)                 # len(y) = 2048
```

Phase-continuous across blocks:

```python
for block in iq_stream:              # 4096-sample CF32 arrays
    y = decim.execute(block)
    next_stage(y)
```

## `CIC` — cascaded integrator-comb decimator

Fixed-rate integer decimation by a power-of-two factor R.  Fixed at N=4
stages, M=1.  Runs directly on the input stream at full rate — no
multipliers, just integrators and combs.  Pair with `ciccompmf` to correct
passband droop.

```python
from doppler.resample import CIC, ciccompmf
import numpy as np

cic = CIC(16)                   # R=16, N=4 (fixed), M=1 (fixed)
x = np.random.randn(4096).astype(np.complex64)
y = cic.decimate(x)             # len(y) = 256

# Design a 7-tap droop compensator (runs at output rate)
h = ciccompmf(N=4, R=16, M=7)  # NDArray[float64], length 7
```

---

## `ciccompmf` — CIC droop-compensator design

Closed-form maximally-flat FIR compensator (Molnar & Vucic, IEEE TCAS-II
58(12):926–930, 2011).  Returns a symmetric FIR kernel that corrects CIC
passband droop; apply it at the decimated output rate.

```python
from doppler.resample import ciccompmf

h = ciccompmf(N=4, R=16, M=7)
# h is NDArray[float64] of length M=7, DC gain ≈ 1.0
```

Valid M: odd 1–19, even 2–18.  Out-of-range M returns all-zeros.
