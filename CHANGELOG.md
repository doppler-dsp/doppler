## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **User bit-pattern waveform type (`bits`)** — `Synth(type="bits",   pattern=…, modulation=…)` and the `bits(pattern, modulation)` builder play
    back a specific bit sequence (preambles, sync words, test vectors). The
    pattern is a 0/1 string (`"10110101"`), a hex string (`"0xAA55"`, MSB
    first), or any array-like of 0/1; `modulation` maps it to symbols
    (`"none"` → 0/1 amplitude, `"bpsk"` → ±1, `"qpsk"` → two bits/symbol,
    Gray-coded). Each bit is held `sps` samples and the pattern **cycles** to
    fill the requested length (one pass is `Synth.n_samples`). On every face:
    the `wfmgen --type bits --bits/--bits-hex/--bits-file --modulation …` CLI,
    the JSON spec (`"pattern"` + `"modulation"`), `Segment`/`Composer` (incl.
    `.sum` scenes), and SigMF. Byte-identical CLI ⇄ Composer ⇄ standalone, and
    the C `wfm_synth_step()`/`wfm_synth_steps()` paths agree bit-for-bit.
    (#114)

## [0.11.0] — 2026-06-11

The **waveform composer** and the **`wfm` API cleanup**. doppler can now build a
multi-source *scene* — a signal of interest, interferers, and a noise floor mixed
at one sample rate — and sequence scenes into a timeline, with full amplitude
bookkeeping (per-source level, headroom, clip detection). Alongside it, the whole
waveform subsystem is unified under one `wfm` name: one Python package
(`doppler.wfm`), one engine object (`Synth`), and one CLI (`wfmgen`).

> **Breaking (pre-1.0):** the Python import path, the `Synth`/`Source` model, two
> builder/method parameters, and the C symbol prefix all changed. See **Changed**
> / **Removed** below and the migration table in the
> [Waveform Generator guide](https://doppler-dsp.github.io/doppler/guide/wfmgen/).

### Added

- **Waveform composition** — mix and sequence waveforms into a scene:
    - `Segment.sum(*synths, num_samples=…)` mixes several `Synth` at the same time
        over **one resolved noise floor** — computed once, in C, so the Python /
        JSON / `wfmgen --from-file` faces are byte-identical. (#99, #100, #101)
    - `Segment.add(*segments)` and `Timeline` sequence segments back-to-back in
        time. (#102)
    - Per-source **`level`** (dBFS), **`--headroom`** (SNR-invariant output
        scaling so peaks fit full-scale), and **clip detection** (`peak_dbfs` /
        `clip_fraction`; `--clip-report` / `--clip-error`). (#96, #97, #98, #103)
    - The JSON spec gains a `"sum"` array; SigMF emits one annotation per source.
- **`wfm_io_demo`** + a Waveform I/O gallery page: write one capture to all four
    containers (raw / CSV / BLUE / SigMF) and read each back, showing which
    metadata each recovers. (#104, #110)

### Changed

- **The waveform subsystem is unified under `wfm`** (the API cleanup):
    - **Python package `doppler.wfmgen` → `doppler.wfm`**, with **one import
        path** — `from doppler.wfm import …` re-exports the whole surface.
        **(breaking)** (#106, #109)
    - **One waveform object `Synth`** that both generates (`.steps()` / `.step()`
        / `.reset()`) and composes (passed straight into `Segment.sum`). `Source`
        is gone; the builders `tone()` / `bpsk()` / `qpsk()` / `pn()` / `noise()`
        return `Synth`. **(breaking)** (#109)
    - **One CLI, `wfmgen`** — a single waveform from flags *or* a multi-segment
        scene from `--from-file`, into raw / CSV / BLUE / SigMF, to file / stdout
        / `zmq://`. The wheel now ships the `wfmgen` binary + a console-script
        shim that `exec`s it. (#107)
    - Parameter renames: **`noise(level=)`** (was `nf=`) and
        **`Segment.sum(num_samples=)`** (was `n=`). **(breaking)** (#109)
    - C symbols **`synth_*` → `wfm_synth_*`**; the C sources moved under
        `native/{src,inc}/wfm/`. **(breaking, C ABI)** (#106)

### Removed

- **The single-shot `wavegen` tool** — the C binary, the PEP 723 script, and the
    Python CLI. A one-segment `wfmgen` run is byte-for-byte identical to it, so
    `wfmgen` is now the only CLI. **(breaking)** (#107)
- `Synth`'s `get_*` / `set_*` engine accessors are no longer on the public object
    (internal engine state). **(breaking)** (#109)

## [0.10.2] — 2026-06-10

Build, tooling, and documentation release — the importable API and C ABI are
**identical to 0.10.1** (no functional library change). Ships the build cleanup
from adopting just-makeit 0.19.0 and a new representative Benchmarks page.

### Added

- **Dedicated Benchmarks page** (`docs/benchmarks.md`) with representative,
    hand-measured numbers committed under `benchmarks/published/`. Each release
    is measured in two builds — **portable** (the PyPI wheel) and **native**
    (`-DDOPPLER_NATIVE=ON`) — run **interleaved** to denoise the comparison;
    throughput is reported in MSa/s, and every snapshot carries full
    reproducibility metadata (CPU + scaling governor, compiler + flags,
    glibc/NumPy versions, commit, timestamp). (#78–#89)

### Removed

- **Unused Windows MinGW CMake boilerplate** from every component. doppler has
    been Linux/macOS-only since 0.10.1; adopting **just-makeit 0.19.0** — which
    gates the per-component Windows DLL-copy block behind `[project] platforms`,
    resolving the doppler-filed
    [jm#213](https://github.com/just-buildit/just-makeit/issues/213) — drops
    ~200 lines of dead build scaffolding. The wheel is unaffected. (#90)

### Changed

- Pin just-makeit **0.18.0 → 0.19.0** (manifest-drift gate + benchmark tooling).
- Developer tooling: a `.clangd` config that silences diagnostics the compile
    database can't resolve; CMake now always exports `compile_commands.json`;
    and a PR CI gate that flags leaked AVX instructions in the portable build.
    (#73, #74, #83)

## [0.10.1] — 2026-06-09

Bug-fix release: two macOS arm64 correctness issues surfaced by the new macOS
test gate added in 0.10.0. Both are pre-existing — not 0.10.0 regressions.

### Fixed

- **VM-mirrored ring buffers (`F32Buffer` / `F64Buffer` / `I16Buffer`) were
    unusable on 16 KiB-page systems (macOS arm64).** `create()` rejected any
    sub-page request — `F32Buffer(1024)` is 8 KiB, below one 16 KiB page — so
    the double-mapping could not be constructed. Sizes are now rounded **up** to
    the smallest power-of-two that spans a whole page; read the real size back
    from `.capacity` (it may exceed the request). 4 KiB-page (Linux x86-64)
    behaviour is unchanged. The Windows path aligns to the 64 KiB allocation
    granularity for the same reason. (#66)
- **The Python `Composer` diverged byte-for-byte from the `wavegen` CLI for
    `qpsk` / `cf32` on arm64.** The composer pulled samples through the scalar
    `synth_step()` while the CLI uses the block `synth_steps()`; under
    `-ffast-math` those contract fused multiply-adds differently, and QPSK's
    irrational ±1/√2 symbol leg exposed the ULP gap (other waveforms' ±1/0 legs
    are exact, so they were immune; it also rounded away under `ci16`/`ci8`,
    leaving only `cf32` affected). The composer now drives the **same**
    `synth_steps()` the CLI uses, so both faces are byte-identical by
    construction. (#67)

## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-09

The headline is **broadened Python support: 3.9 – 3.14** (the floor drops from
3.11). doppler's C extensions were already 3.9-clean — no `Py_NewRef`-era API,
no runtime PEP-604 unions, no `match`/`case` — so the floor was set entirely by
NumPy (2.1 dropped 3.9, 2.3 dropped 3.10), not by doppler. Lowering it is
packaging plus two small fixes flushed out by the new CI rows.

### Changed

- **Supported Python is now 3.9 – 3.14** (`requires-python = ">=3.9"`). Each
    interpreter resolves a compatible dependency set via PEP 508
    `python_version` environment markers — NumPy is capped per-version
    (`<2.1` on 3.9, `<2.3` on 3.10) in both the runtime deps and the build
    backend, so the cp39 wheel builds against NumPy 2.0.x and runs against any
    later 2.x via the stable ABI. The dev group caps `scipy` / `matplotlib` /
    `pytest` the same way. CI gains 3.9 / 3.10 / 3.11 test rows and the release
    wheel matrices gain cp39 – cp311 (manylinux_2_28 x86_64 + macOS arm64).

### Fixed

- **`SpecanConfig` pydantic fields** use `Optional[float]`, not PEP-604
    `float | None`. pydantic force-evaluates field annotations via
    `get_type_hints` at class-definition time, which raises on Python 3.9
    (`from __future__ import annotations` does not help — pydantic resolves the
    deferred strings), breaking CLI test collection. Functionally identical;
    3.9-safe.
- **`test_missing_extras`** reproduces a stdlib-only "bare" install with an
    in-process import-blocker instead of a nested `venv.create()` interpreter.
    A venv created under a uv-managed python-build-standalone interpreter (the
    new 3.9 / 3.10 CI rows) cannot bootstrap its own stdlib and died before the
    CLI's install-hint could print; blocking the extras' imports in the working
    interpreter tests identically on every version.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-08

The headline is **real-time pacing + a container reader**: a C-first sample
clock that emits and timestamps samples at their true rate, and the `Reader`
dual of `Writer`.

### Added

- **`Reader` — the dual of `Writer`** (`wfm_reader`, C-first; Python bind-only)
    — reads a capture back to `complex64`, **auto-detecting** the container
    (BLUE `"BLUE"` magic / `.sigmf-meta` sidecar / `.csv` / raw). Self-describing
    containers (BLUE, SigMF) recover sample type, byte order, `fs` and `fc` from
    metadata; headerless raw/CSV take hints. All detection, header parsing and
    wire→unit conversion live in C; `doppler.wfmgen.compose.Reader` is thin glue
    (`.read()` / `.read_all()` + `file_type` / `sample_type` / `fs` / `fc` /
    `num_samples`). Round-trips every container against the writer.

- **Benchmarks** for the new subsystems: `bench_timing_core`,
    `bench_wfm_writer_core`, `bench_wfm_reader_core` (C, via `make bench`) and
    `bench_timing` / `bench_compose` (Python, pytest-benchmark).

- **Real-time sample-clock pacing + timestamping** (`timing_core`, C-first) —
    a `dp_sample_clock_t` that paces a producer to `fs` on a drift-free
    `epoch + n/fs` schedule (mimicking a hardware sample clock) and stamps
    blocks with their ideal UNIX-epoch-ns time. Exposed both ways:

    - **CLI**: `wfmgen --realtime` throttles the emit loop to `fs` (zmq or
        file); `--realtime-resync` re-anchors on underrun. Pacing is
        byte-transparent and reports an underrun summary at exit.
    - **Python**: `doppler.wfmgen.compose.SampleClock(fs, resync=...)` with
        `pace()` / `stamp()` / `reset()` / `resync()` and `underruns` /
        `max_lateness` telemetry; the `pace()` sleep releases the GIL.

    POSIX only (mirrors the ZMQ sink). Drift-free because each deadline is
    recomputed from the cumulative sample count, not summed sleeps.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-08

The headline is the **C composer subsystem, now in Python** — the multi-segment
waveform engine behind the `wfmgen` CLI, exposed as an ergonomic class API whose
output is byte-identical to the CLI.

### Added

- **`doppler.wfmgen.compose`** — the Python face of the C `wfmgen` composer /
    writer / sink subsystem (~18 C functions), a hand-written `no_generate`
    CPython module (the `ddc_fn` pattern: opaque PyCapsules, GIL released around
    the kernels):

    - **`Segment` + `Composer`** — multi-segment streams (per-segment on-time and
        trailing gap), `repeat` / `continuous`, streaming `execute()` / one-shot
        `compose()`, and a JSON spec round-trip (`to_json` / `from_json` /
        `from_file`).
    - **`Writer`** — raw / CSV / BLUE type-1000 / SigMF containers, pairing with
        `read_iq`; plus `sigmf_meta()` and `write_blue_header()` helpers.
    - **`ZmqSink`** (POSIX) — ZeroMQ PUB with the wfmgen fs/fc framing, decodable
        by `doppler.stream.Subscriber`.
    - **`rrc_taps`, `dsss_spread`, `mls_poly`** free functions.

    Output is byte-identical to the `wavegen` / `wfmgen` CLIs — proven by 15 md5
    byte-parity tests (5 waveform types × 3 sample types) against the CLI, plus a
    `ZmqSink`→`Subscriber` loopback, BLUE/SigMF container tests, and JSON /
    Writer↔`read_iq` round-trips (33 pytests, doctests on every public symbol).

### Changed

- The `nogil` execute bindings (`ddc`, `ddcr`) and the new composer binding are
    GNU-formatted with `Py_BEGIN/END_ALLOW_THREADS` treated as block macros, so
    clang-format keeps each on its own line (synced to just-makeit's canonical
    `.clang-format`).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **`I32ToF32` / `I8ToF32` converters** (`doppler.cvt`) — int32→float32 and
    int8→float32 with configurable full-scale, round-trip tested against the
    F32→int writers.
- **`read_iq()`** (`doppler.wfmgen.readback`) — read an interleaved-I/Q capture
    back into a complex NumPy array: cf32/cf64 as a zero-copy complex view,
    ci8/16/32 rescaled through the fast int→f32 converters, `raw=True` for the
    raw `(N, 2)` view. Documented alongside the interleaved-I/Q view-vs-copy
    table in `docs/types.md`.
- **Comprehensive docstrings + doctests across all 16 modules** — every public
    class, method, function, and property now carries a full numpy-style docstring
    with a verified, runnable `Examples` doctest (884 doctest lines, CI-gated via
    `pytest --doctest-glob`), synthesized from the C-header Doxygen by
    just-makeit 0.18.0 (`@code` → `Examples`).

### Changed

- just-makeit pin → **0.18.0** (header-derived docstrings, `@code` doctests,
    built-in `step`/`steps`/`reset` deriving from the header `@brief`).

### Tooling

- **pre-commit** — ruff (lint + format), clang-format (pinned v19), mdformat,
    and hygiene hooks, enforced by a CI `pre-commit` job. jm-generated glue is
    excluded (owned by the `jm status --check` manifest-drift gate).

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-07

The headline is a new **waveform generator** — a C-first synthesis engine with
two command-line tools and a Python API — plus a substantial throughput pass on
the signal-source primitives and a refreshed brand and docs site.

### Added

- **Waveform generator (`doppler.wfmgen`)** — five waveform types (tone, noise,
    PN, BPSK, QPSK) from one declarative C engine, exposed three ways:
    - **`wavegen`** — single-shot generator with three byte-identical faces
        (C binary, console script, PEP 723), `--sample_type cf32|cf64|ci32|ci16|ci8`,
        `--file_type raw|csv|blue|sigmf`, `--endian le|be`, and `--record`.
    - **`wfmgen`** — multi-segment composer: JSON specs via `--from-file` /
        `--record` (byte-exact round-trip), off-time gaps, repeat / continuous, and
        a ZMQ PUB sink (`--output zmq://…`).
    - Python API: `Synth` (the engine) and `PN` (raw LFSR m-sequence).
- **64-bit PN/LFSR** with a verified primitive-polynomial table for **every
    length 2..64** (`--pn_length`, `--pn_poly`); auto-MLS when `--pn_poly 0`.
- **Fibonacci LFSR** alongside Galois — `--lfsr galois|fibonacci`
    (`lfsr=` on `Synth`/`PN`); same polynomial and period, different realization.
- **BLUE type-1000** output: a complete 512-byte Header Control Block, **attached
    or detached** (`--detached` → `<out>.hdr` + `<out>.det`).
- **SigMF** output (`--file_type sigmf`): `.sigmf-data` + `.sigmf-meta` with one
    annotation per composer segment.
- **`ddc_fn`** — the functional down-converter API promoted to first-class
    (re-exported from `doppler.ddc`, with a gallery walkthrough).
- Brand kit (wordmark, favicon, social / app icons) and a Python API-reference
    page for `wfmgen`, plus a runnable `examples/python/pn_codes.py`.

### Changed

- **AWGN AVX-512 is now runtime-dispatched.** The 8-wide generator is selected
    at run time via `__builtin_cpu_supports`, so the distribution-safe wheel uses
    it on capable CPUs and falls back to scalar on older hardware — no new runtime
    dependency (libmvec is referenced through a weak symbol). ~2.6× noise
    throughput on AVX-512 machines.
- **The synth engine is fully batched.** The LO carrier and AWGN are generated a
    block at a time (vectorized), PN chips come from the block generator, clean
    waveforms (`snr ≥ 100`) skip AWGN entirely, and baseband (`freq 0`) skips the
    LO — byte-identical output, with the PN/LFSR path reaching ~1 GSa/s.
- Documentation site migrated from Zensical to **mkdocs-material**.

### Fixed

- Benchmark CI now captures the **C (`jm_bench`) suite** to the `benchmarks`
    branch (previously Python-only); the benchmarking docs were corrected to match,
    and the advisory perf-regression gate's just-makeit pin was aligned to 0.17.1.
- `zensical.toml` is no longer re-committed by `jm apply` (gitignored).

### Tests & docs

- Comprehensive waveform-generator **user guide** and **gallery**; the
    benchmarking guide now matches the workflows. PN/Fibonacci/64-bit coverage at
    the C, CLI, and Python layers (1046 Python tests, 41 C tests).

## [0.5.5] — 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Runtime `__doc__` now matches the derived docs — for real this time.**
    0.5.4 derived numpy docstrings into the `.pyi` stubs, but the C runtime docs
    (`help(DDC.execute)`, `DDC.__doc__`, property docs) still showed the stale
    scaffold fallback ("Zero-copy view…", "DDC type."), because those strings
    live in the sacred per-object `<mod>_ext_<obj>.c` binding fragments that
    `jm apply` does not regenerate. Upgraded just-makeit to **0.14.12** (the
    doc-slot refresh landed in 0.14.11; 0.14.12 is the first published build to
    carry it), whose `apply` transplants the derived docstrings into the
    fragment's `PyMethodDef`
    / `PyGetSetDef` / `tp_doc` slots — but **only** where the slot still holds
    the scaffold form or is empty. Hand-written docstrings and bindings the
    manifest can't express are preserved untouched: `RateConverter`'s rich class
    doc and `stages` accessor, and the `cvt` `clipped` getters, are unchanged.
    Now `DDC.execute.__doc__` really is "Mix input block with LO, then
    rate-convert." and `DDC.norm_freq.__doc__` is "Return the current LO
    normalised frequency.".

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.5.4] — 2026-06-04

### Added

- **Rich Python docstrings, derived from the C headers.** Upgraded the
    just-makeit toolchain to 0.14.7, which synthesizes numpy-style docstrings
    for every class, method, and property from the hand-written Doxygen
    (`@brief`/`@param`/`@return`) already in each `<obj>_core.h`. The generated
    `.pyi` stubs (and the C bindings' `__doc__`) now carry real documentation
    instead of `"""Execute."""` — e.g. `help(DDC.execute)` shows "Mix input
    block with LO, then rate-convert." with its parameters. The header stays the
    single source of truth; `jm apply` regenerates the docs.
- **Doctest gate in CI.** The synthesized `.pyi` examples are run against the
    freshly built extensions (`pytest --doctest-glob='*.pyi'`), so a docstring
    that drifts from the API fails CI.

### Fixed

- Hand-written `stream.pyi` doctests that perform live socket I/O are marked
    `# doctest: +SKIP` (they need a running peer); the `get_timestamp_ns`
    example gains the blank line doctest-as-text parsing requires.

## [0.5.3] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **`doppler-specan` no longer hangs on "Waiting for signal…".** The specan
    engine was never updated after the ddc/spectral/jm migrations and referenced
    five renamed/removed extension APIs; every per-block failure was swallowed by
    the display's DSP loop, turning a hard error into a silent forever-hang.
    Restored: `DDC` (was `Ddc`), the 2-arg `DDC(norm_freq, rate)` constructor,
    the `norm_freq` property setter (was `set_freq`), a specan-local
    `kaiser_beta_for_enbw` (deleted in the migration) adapted to the in-place
    `kaiser_window`, and `FFT.execute_cf32` (was `FFT.execute`).
- The terminal DSP loop now records and **displays** processing errors instead
    of silently retrying — a persistent failure shows a diagnostic panel.

### Added

- First integration tests for `doppler.specan` — drive the full demo → DDC →
    Kaiser → FFT → peak-detection chain through the real C extensions, so an
    extension-API drift can no longer ship undetected.

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.5.2] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **Published Linux wheels are now portable.** The 0.5.1 manylinux wheel was
    built with `-march=native`, baking the CI build host's AVX-512 instructions
    into the binary; on any CPU without AVX-512 it crashed at first use with
    `Illegal instruction (core dumped)` (e.g. `doppler-specan --source demo`).
    The build's `-march` portability guard keyed on a `CIBUILDWHEEL` env var that
    the release workflow (`python -m build`, not cibuildwheel) never set, so the
    guard never fired.

### Changed

- **`-march` policy inverted to safe-by-default.** All builds, including every
    release/wheel path, now target a portable baseline (`x86-64-v2` on x86-64);
    `-march=native` is strictly opt-in via `-DDOPPLER_NATIVE=ON` (`make blazing`)
    for local dev/bench only. Correctness no longer depends on any CI tool
    exporting an env var.
- The release workflow now disassembles every bundled extension and **fails the
    release if any AVX2/AVX-512 (`%ymm`/`%zmm`) instruction is present**, so a
    non-portable wheel can never be published again.

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.5.1] — 2026-06-03

### Added

- **`doppler.arith`** — Q8/Q15 fixed-point arithmetic module. `AccQ15` /
    `AccQ8` saturating accumulators, plus elementwise `add`/`sub`/`mul`/`dot`/
    `shl`/`shr` for Q15 and Q8 arrays (`add_q15`, `mul_q8`, `dot_q15`, …) and
    `shl_i64`/`shr_i64`. Two's-complement saturation with round-half-up.
- "Getting Started with Fixed-Point Arithmetic" guide.

### Changed

- Upgraded the just-makeit toolchain to 0.14.4. `ddc` / `ddcr` /
    `RateConverter` now declare `pass_capacity`, so jm generates their 5-arg
    `*_execute(..., out, max_out)` signature directly (no hand-patched header).
    `ddc_fn` is declared as a `no_generate` module so its CMake wiring is
    jm-managed.
- CI gained a native manifest-drift gate (`jm status --check`); the generated
    glue is asserted in sync with `just-makeit.toml` on every run.
- Vendored cJSON 1.7.19 under `vendor/cjson/` (drop-in, not yet wired into the
    build).

### Fixed

- **`doppler.source` import failure on some Linux toolchains**
    (`source.so: undefined symbol: _ZGVdN8v_logf`). GCC auto-vectorises
    `awgn`'s `logf` into a libmvec call; the extension now links `libmvec` on
    Linux.
- `spectral` `kaiser_window` / `hann_window` header drift — `w` is now a
    writable out-param, so `jm apply` no longer adds a spurious `const`.

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added

- **`doppler.cvt.ADC`** — signed N-bit (1–64) two's-complement ADC model.
    Configurable full-scale level (`dbfs`), optional TPDF dither, sticky
    `clipped` flag, and `steps()` with SIMD float-scale path. Accepts any
    bit depth; uses `double` precision scale for bits > 23.
- **`doppler.cvt.ADCIQ`** — CF32 → interleaved IQ int16 wrapper around `ADC`.
    Exploits the complex64 memory layout (I₀ Q₀ I₁ Q₁ …) to process both
    channels in a single SIMD call. Restricted to bits ≤ 16 so output fits
    int16.
- **`doppler.filter.HBDecimQ15`** — fixed-point halfband 2:1 decimator for
    interleaved IQ int16 (ADCIQ output format → 2:1 decimated IQ int16).
    AVX2 inner loop uses a two-pass `_mm256_madd_epi16` strategy (left side +
    right side reversed) that avoids computing the symmetric fold as int16,
    eliminating saturation at any valid input level. I and Q run as two
    independent madd chains on the same coefficient vector — free ILP on any
    superscalar core. Scalar fallback for non-AVX2 targets.
- **Functional DDCR API** (`doppler.ddc.ddcr_create` / `ddcr_execute` /
    `ddcr_reset` / `ddcr_destroy` / `ddcr_get_norm_freq` / `ddcr_set_norm_freq`
    / `ddcr_get_rate`) — state passed explicitly as an opaque capsule rather
    than bound to a Python object; suited for multi-pipeline use cases.
- **Gallery examples**: ADC quantisation staircase (3–8 bits, time + spectrum)
    and HBDecimQ15 (frequency response Q15 vs float32, input/output spectra
    showing −60 dB stopband suppression).

### Changed

- **`doppler.ddc` build layout**: `ddc_fn_ext.c` moved to
    `native/src/ddc_fn/` with its own `CMakeLists.txt`, isolated from
    `just-makeit` regeneration so `jm apply` can no longer clobber the
    functional DDCR API.

### Fixed

- **HBDecimQ15 SIMD**: replaced `_mm256_adds_epi16` (saturating fold) with
    two-pass `_mm256_madd_epi16`; the saturating add clipped fold values above
    −6 dBFS and destroyed the stopband cancellation at frequencies where
    adjacent delay-line samples are in-phase (e.g. f = 0.45 with a 60 dB
    halfband design gives fold ≈ 38 044 > 32 767, turning a theoretical
    −82 dBFS null into −29 dBFS leakage).

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.4.6] — 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- Release workflow now publishes all artifact types: sdist, Linux x86_64 and
    macOS arm64 C library tarballs (headers + static + shared libs), and OCI
    packages on GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`).

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.4.1] — 2026-05-26

### Added

- **`F32ToUQ15` / `UQ15ToF32`** — offset-binary uint16 converters in
    `doppler.cvt`. Encode: `v_Q15 + 32768 → uint16` (−1.0 → 0, 0.0 → 32768,
    ~+1.0 → 65535). `F32ToUQ15` has a sticky `clipped` property identical to
    `F32ToI16`. 13 new tests; roundtrip error ≤ 0.5 LSB.
- **`docs/design/QUANTIZATION.md` — §7.1 UQ15 definition**: formal
    encode/decode formulas, code-point table, and reference to the new cvt
    converters. The document is now reachable from the website nav under
    **Design → Quantization**.
- **`docs/types.md` — quantization schemes table**: Q15, I16U32, I16U64,
    UQ15, and UQ16 listed with container type, zero-code, and one-line
    description; links to QUANTIZATION.md.

### Fixed

- **Stream module test coverage**: 28 tests covering all six socket patterns
    (PUSH/PULL, PUB/SUB, REQ/REP) with CI32, CF64, and CF128 types; context
    manager and timeout tests added.
- **cvt gallery decode example** (`docs/gallery/cvt-quantization.md`):
    corrected snippet to show the `I16ToF32` decode step and the `clipped`
    property; demo signal amplitudes rescaled to stay within Q15 full-scale.
- **CIC gallery snippet** (`docs/gallery/cic.md`): added missing `f_jammer`
    variable and `_tone` helper so the example is copy-pasteable.
- **CIC alias comment** (`examples/python/cic_demo.py`): `aliases to 48 kHz`
    corrected to `aliases to -48 kHz` (208 kHz − 2×128 kHz = −48 kHz).

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-26

### Changed

- **Breaking**: `CIC` constructor and `reconfigure()` now take only `R`
    (decimation ratio). `N` and `M` are fixed constants (`N=4`, `M=1`) and
    are no longer accepted as arguments. The `N`, `M`, `input_scale`, and
    `output_scale` properties are removed; `shift` (`= 4 * log2(R)`) is
    added.
- CIC internal encoding switched from sign-extended Q15 to offset-binary
    UQ16 (`v_Q15 + 32768 → uint64`). All integrator/comb arithmetic is now
    purely unsigned, eliminating the C99 implementation-defined
    `(int16_t)(uint16_t)v` cast in the output path.
- Zero CF32 input now produces a non-zero transient for the first `N=4`
    output periods (the DC offset bias ramps the integrators before the comb
    chain fills); output is exactly `0+0j` from index 4 onward.

### Added

- `F32ToI16`, `F32ToI16U32`, `F32ToI16U64`: sticky `clipped` property
    (`bool`) — reads `True` if any sample has been saturated since the last
    `reset()`.
- `docs/design/QUANTIZATION.md`: full C99 cast-chain analysis for both
    UQ16 encode and decode paths.
- Spectral purity roundtrip tests for all three cvt encoder/decoder pairs
    (−80 dBc threshold, `src/doppler/cvt/tests/test_roundtrip_spectral.py`).
- Gallery: Q15 vs UQ15 quantization demo (`examples/python/q15_uq15_demo.py`)
    and cvt quantization noise comparison (`examples/python/cvt_quantization_demo.py`).

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.3.7] — 2026-05-24

### Changed

- CI now uses `jbx install-deps` to install system dependencies from
    `jb.toml`, replacing inline `apt-get`/`brew install` blocks.
- `jb.toml` is the single system-deps manifest; the standalone
    `install-deps.sh` shim and `jb-deps.toml` are removed.
- Benchmark workflow runs automatically on release tags only; opt-in
    via `workflow_dispatch` otherwise.
- Benchmark snapshots are capped at 512 KB to prevent `stats.data`
    arrays from bloating the repository.

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.3.6] — 2026-05-22

### Added

- **`Resampler` custom filter bank** — `Resampler` accepts an optional
    `bank=` keyword argument to supply a pre-computed polyphase filter
    bank, routing to `resamp_create_custom` internally.
- **`HalfbandDecimatorDp` / `HalfbandDecimatorR2C`** — two new Python
    types wrapping the double-precision and real-to-complex halfband
    decimator variants; both are exported from `doppler.resample`.
- **Gallery examples** — detection/correlation and AGC plot-generating
    examples added; `make gallery` target regenerates all gallery images.
- **C examples** — `docs/examples/c.md` filled with working C snippets
    covering AGC, FIR filter, delay, source, accumulator, and resample.

### Fixed

- **FIR heap corruption** — `FIR.execute` used a pre-allocated output
    buffer sized by `fir_execute_max_out()`, which returns 0 at
    construction time. `malloc(0)` produced a zero-byte allocation that
    every `execute` call silently overflowed. Output is now allocated
    fresh per call with `PyArray_SimpleNew`.
- **FIR real-tap dispatch** — `FIR.__init__` now inspects the tap
    array dtype: `float32` routes to `fir_create_real`; `complex64`
    routes to `fir_create`. Previously only the complex path was wired.
- **`Delay.ptr()` default length** — the default `n` for `ptr()` was
    hardcoded to 1; it now defaults to `handle->num_taps` (the full
    delay line), matching the expected no-argument behaviour.
- **`HalfbandDecimator` argument order** — `HalfbandDecimator_create`
    was called with `(ptr, h_len)` instead of the correct `(h_len, ptr)`.
- **`Resampler.execute_ctrl` guard** — added a length check requiring
    the control array to be at least as long as the input array.
- **Docs build** — `spectral.pyi` used `in` (a Python keyword) as a
    parameter name, causing griffe to silently drop the
    `doppler.spectral.spectral` submodule and fail with
    `AliasResolutionError` on every `zensical build`. Fixed parameter
    names and added missing `from typing import Any`.

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.3.5] — 2026-05-22

### Added

- **`Corr` / `Corr2D`** — cross-correlation components backed by
    `corr_state_t` / `corr2d_state_t`; exported from `doppler.spectral`.
- **`Detector` / `Detector2D`** — CFAR detectors on top of the
    correlators; configurable noise mode (`mean`, `median`, `min`, `max`)
    and per-dwell threshold; exported from `doppler.spectral`.
- **`detection` module** — Marcum Q function, envelope detector, and
    power detector; exported from `doppler.detection`.
- **Python 3.14** — added to the release wheel build matrix.

### Changed

- **`dp_sample_type_t` enum values** — `DP_` prefix dropped
    (e.g. `DP_CF32` → `CF32`). Breaking for C callers using the old names.
- **Stream / pub-sub type names** — `_t` suffix added to
    `dp_pub`, `dp_sub`, `dp_push`, `dp_pull`, `dp_req`, `dp_rep`,
    `dp_f32`, `dp_f64`, `dp_i16`. Breaking for C callers.
- **`DECLARE_DP_BUFFER` macro** — generated typedef now carries the
    `_t` suffix to match the convention above.

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.3.4] — 2026-05-19

### Added

- **`util` module** — a new `doppler.util` extension module. Its first
    function, `square_clip`, clips a complex sample's real and imaginary
    parts independently to a [-lin, lin] box. It is header-only and
    inline, so the AGC and any other module share one definition.
- **AGC output clipping** — `AGC` gains a writable `clip_db` parameter.
    The output is square-clipped to `10^(clip_db/20)` per component,
    applied after the power detector so the control loop is unperturbed.
    Defaults high enough to be effectively off.

### Fixed

- **Linux wheels** — the `agc` extension failed to import on glibc 2.31+
    with `undefined symbol: __exp_finite`. `-ffast-math` emitted glibc's
    removed `__*_finite` math aliases when built in the manylinux image;
    the SIMD flags now include `-fno-finite-math-only`.
- **Wheel CPU portability** — released x86-64 wheels were built with
    `-march=native`, baking in the CI runner's instruction set. Wheels
    built under cibuildwheel now target a portable `x86-64-v2` baseline;
    local builds keep `-march=native`.

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.3.3] — 2026-05-19

### Added

- **AGC** — a log-domain automatic gain control component. Feedback
    loop with a 1st-order log-domain loop filter, an EMA power detector,
    and linear-in-dB gain, so settling time is independent of input
    level. `agc_steps()` runs a decimated control loop with a
    first-order-hold gain ramp and an explicit-SIMD power reduction;
    exposes `applied_gain_db` (the gain the signal actually saw)
    alongside the commanded `gain_db`.

### Changed

- Benchmarking now delegates to `just-makeit bench`, which writes
    trimmed, dated snapshots to `benchmarks/history/`. Raw per-iteration
    timing arrays are dropped, keeping committed snapshots small.

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.3.2] — 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- `doppler.__version__` now resolves correctly under the `doppler-dsp`
    PyPI distribution name.

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-18

### Added

- **C examples** (`examples/c/`): seven self-contained, runnable C programs
    — `nco_demo`, `fir_demo`, `hbdecim_demo`, `fft_demo` (DSP demos) and
    `transmitter`, `receiver`, `pipeline_demo`, `spectrum_analyzer`
    (streaming demos using ZMQ PUB/SUB and PUSH/PULL). All link
    `doppler_lib_static` so they run without a system `libdoppler.so`.
- **Python examples** (`examples/python/`): `fir_demo.py`,
    `transmitter.py`, `receiver.py` — end-to-end scripts exercising the
    Python bindings and streaming API.
- **`doppler.__version__`**: the installed package version is now
    available as `doppler.__version__` (via `importlib.metadata`);
    resolves to `"unknown"` when the package is not installed.
- **Docker Compose demo**: `docker compose up` now starts a full
    streaming pipeline — transmitter, two receivers, and a spectrum
    analyzer — as separate containers; all example binaries are included
    in the runtime image.
- **`make test-examples`**: runs the C example binaries as smoke tests
    (FFT, FIR, NCO, halfband decimator); part of `make test-all`.
- **`make test-examples-python`**: runs Python example smoke tests;
    part of `make test-all`.

### Changed

- **PyPI distribution**: the package is published as `doppler-dsp`. The
    former separate `doppler-cli` and `doppler-specan` packages are now
    optional extras of `doppler-dsp` rather than standalone distributions.
- **CMake install**: `doppler_lib_static` (`libdoppler.a`) is now
    installed without being added to the `doppler-targets` CMake export
    set. The shared library (`doppler::doppler`) remains the primary
    CMake-integrated target; users who want static linking can link
    `libdoppler.a` directly alongside `-lstdc++ -lpthread -lm`.

### CI

- **glibc 2.28 verification** (`glibc-228` job): builds and runs the
    C examples on Debian Buster (glibc 2.28); verifies `libdoppler.so`
    contains no glibc symbols newer than 2.28.

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.2.9] — 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- **CMake version**: `project(VERSION …)` now always receives a
    numeric `X.Y.Z` string; `bump-version` strips Python pre-release
    suffixes (e.g. `a0`) before writing to `CMakeLists.txt`
- **Cargo version**: same suffix-stripping applied to `Cargo.toml`;
    Cargo requires SemVer and rejected `0.2.9a0`
- **`just-build` target**: corrected env-var names from
    `JUST_BUILD_OUTPUT_DIR/PYTHON` to `JUST_BUILDIT_OUTPUT_DIR/PYTHON`;
    empty `mkdir -p` had been failing the Release workflow
- **Specan staleness CI check**: narrowed watched path from
    `python/specan/` to `python/specan/doppler_specan/` so version-bump
    commits no longer falsely trigger the guard

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.2.8] — 2026-05-09

### Added

- **CF32 FFT** (`dp_fft1d_execute_cf32`, `dp_fft1d_execute_inplace_cf32`,
    `dp_fft2d_execute_cf32`, `dp_fft2d_execute_inplace_cf32`): single-
    precision (float complex) FFT variants backed by FFTW `fftwf_*` and
    pocketfft; ~1.9–2.6× faster than CF64 across 1K–16K sizes
- **Python dtype dispatch**: `execute1d`, `execute2d`, `execute`, `fft`
    now auto-route on input dtype — `complex64` → CF32 path with
    `complex64` output; `complex128` → CF64 path unchanged

### Changed

- **CMake**: `libfftw3f` and `libfftw3f_threads` added as FFTW-backend
    dependencies

### Fixed

- **Rust FFI (Windows)**: `build.rs` now links `fftw3f` and
    `fftw3f_threads` on Windows; static `libdoppler.a` requires all
    `fftwf_*` symbol providers to be listed explicitly

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.2.7] — 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Architecture docs** (`docs/architecture.md`): new page explaining
    the four-layer stack (DSP library → transport → pipeline CLI →
    apps); HTML stack diagram with DSP layer highlighted; Mermaid
    compose flow diagram; added to nav between Quick Start and Overview
- **`doppler compose up` status lines**: prints the specan web URL
    immediately after startup (`specan → http://127.0.0.1:8080`);
    extensible via `Block.status_lines()` hook
- **`record_demo` warmup** (`--warmup N`, default 5): discards the
    first N frames before recording so the static demo starts clean;
    fixes startup glitch without patching the player

### Changed

- **`docs/specan/frames.json`** regenerated with warmup; demo player
    no longer needs the `slice(1)` workaround
- **Polyphase docstrings** expanded (`kaiser_beta`, `kaiser_taps`,
    `kaiser_prototype`); `matlab_optimization.py` removed

### Fixed

- **`record_demo`**: removed stale `beta` argument that was rejected
    by `SpecanConfig` after the field was dropped

### CI

- **Python 3.14** added to the test matrix
- **Specan demo staleness check**: new `specan-demo` job fails when
    `python/specan/` changes without a corresponding update to
    `docs/specan/frames.json`

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.2.6] — 2026-04-02

### Added

- **`doppler-cli`** (`python/cli/`): `doppler compose` pipeline
    orchestrator — `init`, `up`, `down`, `ps`, `inspect`, `logs`
    subcommands; ships as a separate pip-installable package
- **Dopplerfile** (`doppler_cli/dopplerfile.py`): YAML-defined
    custom pipeline blocks; `uv run --with` dep isolation; discovery
    from `~/.doppler/blocks/` or CWD; zero Python required to write
    a new block
- **Named compose chains**: `--name` flag on `doppler compose init`;
    name used as the pipeline ID and filename
- **`doppler logs`**: redirects per-block stdout/stderr to dated log
    files; `doppler ps` shows log paths
- **`doppler-source` entry point**: standalone IQ source block for
    use in compose pipelines
- **PUSH/PULL pipeline transport** between CLI blocks; blocks
    discover upstream/downstream ports automatically
- **Timestamped health logging**: all blocks print a startup banner
    with endpoint, PID, and timestamp
- **`web_host` config** in `SpecanConfig` (default `127.0.0.1`);
    allows binding the spectrum analyzer web server to a non-loopback
    address
- **specan: chirp sweep source** — synthetic linear chirp across the
    full display bandwidth; rate and depth configurable
- **specan: max-hold trace** — persists per-bin peak magnitude; can
    be toggled and reset from the UI
- **Recorded chirp demo** (`docs/specan/chirp_frames.json`, 150
    frames, ~470 KB): pre-captured WS frames served by the static
    docs demo without a live server
- **`scripts/capture_specan.py`**: captures live spectrum analyzer
    WS frames to JSON for use as a static demo recording
- **DPMFS resampler Python bindings** (`doppler.resample`):
    `Resampler`, `ResamplerDpmfs`, `HalfbandDecimator`; 40 new pytest
    tests; `fit_dpmfs` / `optimize_dpmfs` design tools
- **Accumulator module** (`doppler.accumulator`): `F32Accumulator`,
    `CF64Accumulator`; typed `.pyi` stubs
- **Delay line module** (`doppler.delay`): `DelayLine`; typed stubs
- **`doppler-specan` standalone package** (`python/specan/`):
    separately pip-installable (`pip install doppler-specan`); serves
    live FFT frames via WebSocket + static HTML UI
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: mandatory checklist — benchmarks, examples,
    NumPy docstrings, typed stubs, cross-language test chain

### Changed

- **`python/doppler/` → `python/dsp/`**: Python source tree renamed
    to avoid collision with the installed `doppler` package name
- **`SpEcan` → `Specan`** throughout (`SpecanEngine`,
    `SpecanConfig`): removed non-standard capitalisation
- **specan: demo controls hidden** when source is not `demo`,
    reducing UI clutter for real-signal use
- **specan: 100dvh layout** — fixes mobile viewport cutoff on
    iOS/Android browsers
- **`doppler compose up`** defaults to the most recently created
    compose file when `--file` is omitted
- **`docs/examples/`**: split `examples.md` into
    `examples/{index,c,python,streaming}.md` for easier navigation
- **Docs index**: rewrote introduction for clarity; added complete
    feature matrix

### Fixed

- **specan: inverted Gaussian** in synthetic chirp magnitude frame
    (peak appeared as a trough)
- **specan: socket source** — CLI option parsing and noise floor
    visibility corrected
- **specan: stale chirp state** not cleared when switching sources

### Build

- **Switched to `just-buildit` PEP 517 backend**: replaces
    `uv_build` + `scripts/retag_wheel.sh`; `just-buildit` calls
    `make just-build`, detects platform from the `.so` suffix, tags
    the wheel correctly, and runs `uvx auditwheel repair` / `uvx delocate-wheel` — all in one `python -m build` invocation
- **macOS arm64 wheels**: `macos-14` runner added to the release
    matrix for Python 3.12 and 3.13

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.2.5] — 2026-04-02

### Changed

- **Default build type `Release`**: `make build` now compiles at
    `-O3 + LTO`, matching the performance numbers in published
    benchmarks (previously `RelWithDebInfo` / `-O2`)

### Fixed

- **`pipeline_demo` missing `pthread`**: LTO resolves all symbols
    directly at link time; `pipeline_demo` used pthreads transitively
    but didn't declare it, causing an undefined reference to
    `pthread_join` under GCC 14 in the manylinux container
- **`python/CMakeLists.txt`: manylinux Python extension build**:
    replaced `uv run python` with `${Python3_EXECUTABLE}` for NumPy
    include-dir and `EXT_SUFFIX` discovery — uv is not present inside
    the manylinux container; added `pip install numpy` to cibuildwheel
    `before-build` so cmake can locate the NumPy headers (numpy is a
    project dep, not a build dep, and is not installed before the
    build step runs)
- **`python/CMakeLists.txt`: macOS Python extension linking**:
    replaced the `string(FIND suffix "so" ...)` hack with
    `if(NOT (UNIX AND NOT APPLE))` — the old check incorrectly treated
    macOS `.cpython-312-darwin.so` as Linux and skipped linking
    `Python3::Python`, causing `_PyExc_ImportError` undefined-symbol
    errors with cibuildwheel's isolated Python on macOS
- **`release.yml`**: removed `macos-14` from the cibuildwheel build
    matrix (macOS arm64 wheels can be added back once the macOS
    extension build is validated end-to-end)
- **`make pyext`**: passes `-DPython3_EXECUTABLE` from the uv venv
    so extension suffixes always match the active interpreter; fixes
    `ModuleNotFoundError` when running pytest under Python 3.13

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.2.3] — 2026-04-02

### Added

- **cibuildwheel** (`release.yml`, `pyproject.toml`): builds proper
    platform wheels for Linux (manylinux_2_28 x86_64) and macOS
    (arm64 via `macos-14`, x86_64 via `macos-13`); replaces the
    single ubuntu-latest wheel build
- **`scripts/retag_wheel.sh`**: retags the `py3-none-any` wheel
    produced by `uv_build` to the correct `cpXYZ-cpXYZ` ABI tag,
    then runs `auditwheel` (Linux) or `delocate` (macOS) to bundle
    shared-lib dependencies
- **`make wheel` target**: local equivalent of the CI wheel build —
    runs `uv build --wheel` then `uvx auditwheel repair` via a new
    CMake `wheel` target (Linux only)
- **Release workflow — all three packages**: `release.yml` now
    builds and publishes `doppler-dsp`, `doppler-specan`, and
    `doppler-cli` to PyPI via a matrix over Linux and macOS;
    `verify-version` checks all three `pyproject.toml` files against
    the tag
- **`make bump-version`** now updates `python/specan/pyproject.toml`
    and `python/cli/pyproject.toml` in addition to the root,
    `Cargo.toml`, and `CMakeLists.txt`

### Changed

- **`docs/build.md`**: corrected all `pip install doppler` →
    `pip install doppler-dsp`; added install instructions for
    `doppler-specan` and `doppler-cli`; fixed from-source commands

______________________________________________________________________

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Rust FFI — NCO bindings** (`ffi/rust/src/nco.rs`): Full Rust
    wrapper for the C NCO API — `Nco::new`, `execute_cf32`,
    `execute_cf32_ctrl`, `execute_u32`, `execute_u32_ovf`, `reset`,
    `set_freq`, `get_freq`; 13 new Rust unit tests
- **Rust FFI — FIR bindings** (`ffi/rust/src/fir.rs`): Full Rust
    wrapper for `dp_fir_t` — `FirFilter::lowpass_f32`,
    `execute_cf32`; included in Rust test suite
- **NCO Rust example** (`ffi/rust/examples/nco_demo.rs`): prints
    IQ samples, FM control-port demo, raw phase accumulator, overflow
    detection
- **`make rust-examples` target**: builds all Rust examples and
    prints their paths (cross-platform, handles `.exe` on Windows)
- **Windows / MSYS2 UCRT64 support** for Rust FFI: static link to
    `libdoppler.a`, `fftw3_threads`, correct MinGW `stdc++`; full
    build + test verified on Windows
- **Release workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`):
    tag-triggered CI that verifies version consistency across
    `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, and `CMakeLists.txt`, builds
    Python wheel, publishes to PyPI via OIDC trusted publishing, and
    creates a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes
- **`make bump-version VERSION=x.y.z`**: atomically updates the
    three version locations
- **`make tag-release VERSION=x.y.z`**: commits the version bump,
    creates an annotated tag, and pushes
- **Zensical documentation**: migrated from mkdocs/Material to
    Zensical (`uv run zensical build --clean`); docs job updated in
    CI; `make docs-build` / `make docs-serve` targets added
- **`make specan` target**: launches live spectrum analyzer in
    browser via `uv run doppler-specan`
- **Windows build guide** in `docs/build.md`: step-by-step MSYS2
    UCRT64 instructions covering all dependencies, cmake, and Rust
    FFI testing

### Changed

- **CI — Windows MSYS2 environment**: switched from `MINGW64` to
    `UCRT64` to match the rest of the toolchain; added
    `mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-rust` to the MSYS2 package list
- **CI — added `make rust-test` steps** to all four OS matrix
    entries (Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04, macOS, Windows)
- **`ffi/rust/build.rs`**: platform-split link strategy — dylib +
    rpath on Linux/macOS, static + `fftw3_threads` + `stdc++` on
    Windows; MinGW LTO workaround removed (handled in CMake)
- **CMakeLists.txt**: LTO disabled on MinGW (`if(NOT MINGW)` guard)
    to prevent `plugin needed to handle lto object` errors when Rust
    links the static archive
- **`python/ext/` renamed to `python/src/`** for clarity (no longer
    looks like a Maturin/Rust extension directory)
- **`docs/build.md`**: added Rust FFI section, UCRT64 Windows
    guide, updated artifact table

### Fixed

- **Rust static link on Windows**: `libdoppler.dll` loaded beyond
    the 2 GB boundary causing pseudo-relocation overflows; fixed by
    linking statically on Windows
- **`make rust-examples` empty output on Windows**: `grep -v '[.\-]'`
    excluded `.exe` files; fixed with `grep -E '^[a-z_]+(\.exe)?$'`

## [0.1.0] — 2025-01-01

### Added

- **NCO** (`c/include/dp/nco.h`, `c/src/nco.c`): 32-bit phase
    accumulator, 2^16-entry sine LUT (~96 dBc SFDR), FM control port
    (`dp_nco_execute_cf32_ctrl`); 59 CTest unit tests
- **FIR filter** (`c/include/dp/fir.h`, `c/src/fir.c`): real and
    complex taps, AVX-512 / scalar paths, CI8/CI16/CI32/CF32 inputs;
    `dp_fir_create`, `dp_fir_execute_*`
- **Lock-free ring buffer** (`c/include/dp/buffer.h`): SPSC ring
    buffer; Python `_buffer` module (`F32Buffer`, `F64Buffer`,
    `I16Buffer`); 20 pytest tests
- **Python FFT tests** (`python/dsp/doppler/tests/test_fft.py`): 20
    pytest tests covering 1D/2D FFT, impulse response, round-trip,
    NumPy parity, dispatcher, one-shot `fft()`
- **Python streaming C extension** (`python/src/dp_stream.c`): all
    6 socket types (Publisher, Subscriber, Push, Pull, Requester,
    Replier) as a zero-copy Python C extension; GIL release on all
    blocking calls; replaces ctypes `client.py`
- **Python buffer C extension** (`python/src/dp_buffer.c`): thin
    wrapper exposing the lock-free ring buffer to Python
- **Rust FFI** (`ffi/rust/`): initial bindings — version, SIMD
    `c16_mul`, 1D/2D FFT; 11 unit tests + 2 doc-tests; `fft_demo`,
    `simd_demo`, `fft_bench` examples; `build.rs` with rpath baking
- **C streaming tests** (`c/tests/test_stream.c`): 26 tests
    covering all socket types (PUB/SUB, PUSH/PULL, REQ/REP), zero-
    copy `dp_msg_t`, timeouts, header validation, error handling
- **Post-install verification** (`c/tests/test_install.sh`): 9
    checks for pkg-config, headers, and linkage
- **Docker**: multi-stage Dockerfile, 130 MB image; `docker-compose.yml`
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 + macOS
    - Windows matrix; Python 3.12/3.13 pytest job; Docker build + smoke-
        test job; coverage upload
- **Makefile**: project wrapper with `build`, `test`, `rust-test`,
    `install`, `install-test`, `pyext`, `python-test`, `test-all`,
    `docker`, `docker-test`, `debug`, `release`, `blazing`, `clean`,
    `help` targets
- **Documentation**: `docs/` site with build guide, API reference,
    quickstart, examples, and design docs

### Changed

- **Zero-copy streaming refactor**: `dp_header_t` expanded with
    `protocol` (`dp_protocol_t`), `stream_id`, `flags` fields;
    `dp_msg_t` opaque handle replaces malloc'd buffers; version
    bumped to 2.0.0; Python extension rewritten from 1693 → 540 lines
- **Static libzmq replaced with system libzmq**: Python extension
    now links the system `libzmq` shared library; `VENDORED.md`
    documents vendoring policy
- **`-Ofast` replaced with `-O3 -ffast-math`** for standards
    compliance
- **SIMD**: x86 intrinsics guarded; ARM scalar fallback added in
    `c/src/simd.c`

### Fixed

- **ARM CI**: guarded x86 intrinsics in `simd.c`
- **NumPy ABI**: compatibility fix for 1.x vs 2.x
- **cmake scatter**: all build artifacts confined to `build/`;
    root-level cmake artifacts cleaned up
- **Python executable matching** in CI for C extension builds
